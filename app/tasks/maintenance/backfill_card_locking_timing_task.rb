module Maintenance
  # Populates persisted card-locking timing (card_charge_settled_at / receipt_due_at /
  # receipt_resolved_at) for every existing relevant charge, via the idempotent
  # materializer. receipt_due_at is set only for charges settled on or after the
  # enforcement start date; older charges get settled/resolved timing (so they
  # still count toward trust) but no due date, so they are never overdue.
