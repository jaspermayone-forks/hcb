# Membership logic behind the Flipper groups registered in
# config/initializers/flipper_groups.rb.
#
# Each predicate takes an already-unwrapped actor (the initializer unwraps
# Flipper::Types::Actor before calling). A flag can be checked against a User or
# an Event actor, so each predicate guards on the actor class it expects and any
# other type falls through to false. This also avoids User/Event id collisions,
# since ids only overlap across classes.
#
# The resolved id sets are cached because a flag using one of these groups may be
# checked on every request. Membership changes come through the org tree in code
# or through OrganizerPositions, neither of which we can cheaply invalidate on, so
# a short TTL keeps the sets fresh enough. The cache keys embed a digest of their
# code-defined source (the org tree, the HQ root ids) so a deploy that edits the
# source busts the cache immediately rather than serving the old set for up to a
# TTL after the new code ships.

  # Root events representing Hack Club HQ. Their managers (and the managers of
  # their descendants) are HQ-descendant users; the events themselves and their
