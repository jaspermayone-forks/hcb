# Managing Receipts with the v4 API

A guide to working with **receipts** in the HCB v4 API. It covers what a receipt is and the endpoints specific to receipts.

> This guide only documents what is **receipt-specific**. For everything general (authentication & OAuth, object shape (`id`/`object`/`created_at`), pagination, error responses, rate limits) see [`standards.md`](./standards.md). For the scope model, see [`scopes.md`](./scopes.md).

> **Handing this to an automated agent?** Also provide [`standards.md`](./standards.md) and [`scopes.md`](./scopes.md): this file does not restate how to authenticate or how the scope model works. At minimum the agent needs the base URL `https://hcb.hackclub.com/api/v4` and an `Authorization: Bearer hcb_<token>` header on every request.

## What Is a Receipt?

A **receipt** is an uploaded file (image, PDF, or CSV) documenting a transaction. It is a polymorphic attachment to a "receiptable" (usually a **transaction**, sometimes a reimbursement expense), or it can be **unattached**, sitting in the user's **Receipt Bin** awaiting a match. On upload, HCB asynchronously runs text extraction and suggests pairings between receipts in the Receipt Bin and transactions missing one.

| | |
|---|---|
| Public ID prefix | `rct` (e.g. `rct_a1b2c3`) |
| API `object` value | `receipt` |
| Accepted file types | `image/*`, `application/pdf`, `text/csv` |
| Max file size | 50 MB |

> A "transaction" in v4 is an `HcbCode`, public-ID prefix `txn`. `transaction_id` means a `txn_…` ID.

### The Receipt Bin

The **Receipt Bin** is a per-user holding area for receipts that aren't attached to any transaction yet. A user adds a receipt to their Receipt Bin when they have the document but haven't matched it to a transaction; HCB then suggests pairings so it can later be attached to the right one. Each user has their own Receipt Bin, and only that user can see or manage its contents. A receipt leaves the Receipt Bin once it's attached to a transaction. Via the API, a receipt lands in the Receipt Bin whenever it's uploaded **without** a `transaction_id`.

### The Receipt Object

Beyond the standard [`object_shape`](./standards.md#object-shape) fields (`id`, `object`, `created_at`):

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `url` | string | URL to the original uploaded file. |
| `preview_url` | string | URL to a generated image preview. |
| `filename` | string | Original filename. |
| `uploader` | object \| null | The `user` who uploaded it, or `null`. |

## Authentication & Scopes

OAuth Bearer tokens as described in [Authentication](./standards.md#authentication). Scopes are only enforced for tokens that also carry `restricted` (see [`scopes.md`](./scopes.md)). Always use a `restricted` token for least privilege: without `restricted`, none of the per-action scopes below are enforced and the token keeps full legacy access to the API.

| Action | Endpoint | Required scope |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| List receipts | `GET /api/v4/receipts` | `receipts:read` |
| Upload a receipt | `POST /api/v4/receipts` | `receipts:write` |
| Delete a receipt | `DELETE /api/v4/receipts/:id` | `receipts:write` |
| Mark a transaction no/lost receipt | `POST /api/v4/transactions/:id/mark_no_receipt` | `receipts:write` |
| Read transactions | `GET /api/v4/transactions/...` | `ledgers:read` |
| Find transactions missing a receipt | `GET /api/v4/transactions/missing_receipt` | `ledgers:read` |

> ⚠️ **`receipts:write` is broad.** A single `receipts:write` scope authorizes uploading **and** deleting receipts **and** marking transactions as no/lost receipt. The scope does not distinguish them. Keeping an agent from deleting or marking receipts is therefore a matter of agent instructions, not scope boundaries (see [Best Practices](#receipt-specific-best-practices)).

> A `restricted` token is **deny-by-default**: it can only reach actions that declare a scope it holds. Scopes gate the token; [Pundit policies](#delete-a-receipt) gate the user. Both must pass.

### Recommended scopes for a receipt agent

An automated agent that uploads receipts from a local directory and attaches them to the right transactions should request a **`restricted`** token carrying exactly:

- **`receipts:write`**: upload receipts and attach them to transactions.
- **`ledgers:read`**: read transactions, to find the ones missing a receipt and match each local file by amount, date, and merchant.
- **`receipts:read`**: list a transaction's existing receipts (and the Receipt Bin), so the agent can skip transactions that already have one instead of uploading duplicates.

This set is sufficient for the full workflow and grants **no ability to move money**: it carries no transfer, ACH, disbursement, or card-grant scopes, and a `restricted` token is denied by default on every action it does not hold a scope for.

## Workflow: Uploading a Directory of Receipts

A typical agent run:

1. **Authenticate.** Obtain a `restricted` OAuth token carrying `receipts:write`, `ledgers:read`, and `receipts:read`. See [Authentication](./standards.md#authentication) for the token flow and [Requesting Scopes on a Token](./scopes.md#requesting-scopes-on-a-token) for how to register the app with these exact scopes and request them. All requests go to `https://hcb.hackclub.com/api/v4` with an `Authorization: Bearer hcb_<token>` header.
2. **Discover transactions missing a receipt** via `GET /transactions/missing_receipt` (across all of the user's organizations in one call), or per organization via `GET /organizations/:id/transactions?filters[missing_receipts]=true`. Both require `ledgers:read`.
3. **Match each local file to a transaction** by amount, date, and merchant. Optionally call `GET /receipts?transaction_id=…` to confirm the transaction does not already have a receipt.
4. **Upload** with `POST /receipts`, always passing `transaction_id` (see [Create a Receipt](#create-a-receipt)).
5. **Skip what you cannot match.** Do not upload unmatched files to the Receipt Bin; flag them for a human.
6. **Never mark a transaction no/lost** without explicit per-transaction human authorization (see [Best Practices](#receipt-specific-best-practices)).

---

## Matching Receipts to Transactions

Matching (workflow step 3) compares two sources: the **receipt file**, which the agent must read or OCR itself (the API exposes no extracted amount, date, or merchant; the [receipt object](#the-receipt-object) carries only `url`, `preview_url`, `filename`, `uploader`), and the **transaction object** from the transactions API. For card charges, the fields worth matching on are:

| Transaction field | Use for matching |
|---|---|
| `amount_cents` | Charge amount in cents. Negative for expenses; compare against the receipt total by absolute value. |
| `date` / `card_charge.spent_at` | Settlement date and the authorization timestamp. A receipt is normally dated the purchase day, which lines up with `spent_at`. |
| `card_charge.merchant.smart_name` / `.name` | Humanized and raw merchant name. `smart_name` is the cleaner one to compare. |
| `memo` | Transaction memo, often merchant-derived. |
| `card_charge.card.last4` | Last 4 of the card used. May be `null`. |

Heuristics, strongest first:

- **Amount must match.** Compare absolute values (`|amount_cents|` against the receipt total in cents). This is a hard filter: a different amount is a different transaction. Two caveats:
  - **Tips/gratuity.** Restaurant charges often settle higher than the printed subtotal. Allow the charged amount to exceed the receipt total by a plausible tip for restaurants; never allow it to be lower.
  - **Currency.** Foreign charges settle in USD while the receipt may be in another currency. If `card_charge.merchant.country` is non-US, lean on merchant and date rather than a raw amount comparison.
- **Dates must be close.** The receipt date should fall on or shortly before `card_charge.spent_at` (authorizations settle a day or two later). A receipt dated well after the charge, or before it, is a non-match. A few days' window is reasonable; a same-day match is a strong signal.
- **Card last4.** If the receipt prints the last 4 digits of the card, they must equal `card_charge.card.last4`. A strong corroborating signal, but `last4` can be `null` and many receipts omit it: treat a match as confirmation and a missing value as neutral, not a mismatch.
- **Merchant name.** Fuzzy-match the receipt's merchant against `smart_name` (fall back to `merchant.name` or `memo`). Normalize case and punctuation, and strip processor prefixes and location noise (e.g. `SQ *`, `TST* `, store numbers, city/state). A clear merchant match disambiguates when several transactions share an amount and date.

Combining the signals:

- Require an **exact amount match plus at least one** corroborating signal (close date, merchant, or last4) before attaching.
- If **multiple transactions** match on amount and date, disambiguate with merchant and last4. If still ambiguous, **skip and flag for a human** rather than guess: attaching to the wrong transaction is worse than leaving it unattached.
- **Only card charges expose merchant and card data.** ACH transfers, checks, donations, and disbursements have no `card_charge` block, so fall back to amount, date, and `memo` for those (uncommon for receipt uploads).

## Request Size & Timeouts

Every request is bound by a **30-second server timeout**. A call that runs longer is terminated, so keep each request small and page through results instead of asking for everything at once.

- **Paginate listings.** Listing endpoints use cursor pagination. The `limit` query param sets the page size: it **defaults to 25** and is **capped at 100** (a larger value returns `400 invalid_operation`). Follow the `after` cursor to page (see [Pagination](./standards.md#pagination)).
- **Prefer smaller pages.** When listing transactions or the Receipt Bin, request modest pages such as `?limit=25` and follow the cursor, rather than pushing `limit` to 100 on a large organization. Smaller pages return faster and stay well under the 30s ceiling.

  ```bash
  curl "https://hcb.hackclub.com/api/v4/transactions/missing_receipt?limit=25" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer hcb_<token>"
  # then pass the last item's id back as ?after=txn_… for the next page
  ```
- **Process per page.** Match and upload as you page, rather than collecting every transaction first. This bounds memory and keeps any single request short.
- **Uploads count too.** `POST /receipts` is also subject to the 30s timeout; a large file (up to 50 MB) over a slow link can approach it. If an upload times out you can't tell whether it landed, and uploads aren't deduped, so check with `GET /receipts?transaction_id=…` before re-uploading.

## Endpoints

All receipt routes are [shallow and top-level](./standards.md#shallow-routing).

### Create a Receipt

```
POST /api/v4/receipts
```

**Required scope:** `receipts:write`

This is the one endpoint that uses **`multipart/form-data`** rather than JSON, because a binary file can't be JSON-encoded.

| Param | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `file` | yes | The receipt file (`image/*`, `application/pdf`, `text/csv`, ≤ 50 MB). |
| `transaction_id` | strongly recommended | A `txn_…` ID. Attaches the receipt to that transaction (user must pass `ReceiptablePolicy#upload?`, i.e. member+ on the org). **If omitted, the receipt goes to the [Receipt Bin](#the-receipt-bin)**, which can only be linked to a transaction via the [re-upload workaround](#linking-a-receipt-in-the-receipt-bin-to-a-transaction). |

```bash
# Attach to a transaction
curl -X POST https://hcb.hackclub.com/api/v4/receipts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer hcb_<token>" \
  -F "transaction_id=txn_abc123" -F "file=@receipt.pdf"
```

Returns `201` with the [receipt object](#the-receipt-object). `upload_method` is set to `api` automatically; extraction and pairing run async after the response.

### List Receipts

```
GET /api/v4/receipts                          # the current user's Receipt Bin (unattached)
GET /api/v4/receipts?transaction_id=txn_abc   # receipts attached to a transaction
```

**Required scope:** `receipts:read`

Returns an array of [receipt objects](#the-receipt-object).

### Delete a Receipt

```
DELETE /api/v4/receipts/:id     # :id is an rct_… ID
```

**Required scope:** `receipts:write`

Governed by `ReceiptPolicy#destroy?`: receipts in the Receipt Bin can be deleted only by the uploader; transaction receipts require member+ on the org (and unlocked); reimbursement-expense receipts require the report owner or org manager (and unlocked); admins always. Returns `{ "message": "Receipt successfully deleted" }`.

### Find Transactions Missing a Receipt

```
GET /api/v4/transactions/missing_receipt
```

**Required scope:** `ledgers:read`

Returns the authenticated user's transactions (across their Stripe cards) still missing a receipt, newest first, [paginated](./standards.md#pagination).

### Mark a Transaction as No / Lost Receipt

```
POST /api/v4/transactions/:id/mark_no_receipt    # :id is a txn_… ID
```

**Required scope:** `receipts:write` · **Last resort, human-gated** (see [Best Practices](#receipt-specific-best-practices))

Removes the transaction from the missing-receipt list when no receipt exists. Requires `ReceiptablePolicy#mark_no_or_lost?` (member+). Returns `{ "message": "Transaction marked as no/lost receipt" }`.

---

## Linking a Receipt in the Receipt Bin to a Transaction

There is no single endpoint that moves a receipt out of the [Receipt Bin](#the-receipt-bin) onto a transaction. You can get the same result by re-uploading the file and deleting the original:

1. **List the Receipt Bin** with `GET /receipts` (`receipts:read`) and identify the receipt to move.
2. **Read its `url`** from the receipt object. This is a signed file URL, downloadable directly with **no `Authorization` header**.
3. **Download the file** from that `url`. Use the `filename` field for the local name.
4. **Upload it to the transaction** with `POST /receipts` (`receipts:write`), passing `transaction_id` and the downloaded `file`. Confirm a `201` before continuing.
5. **Delete the original** from the Receipt Bin with `DELETE /receipts/:id` (`receipts:write`). A receipt in the Receipt Bin can be deleted by its uploader, which is the token's own user.

**Scopes:** `receipts:read` + `receipts:write` (both in the [recommended agent set](#recommended-scopes-for-a-receipt-agent)); the download in step 3 needs no scope.

**Caveats:**

- **Order matters: delete only after a `201` upload.** If you delete first, or the upload fails, the file is gone.
- **Step 4 needs upload permission on the target organization** (`ReceiptablePolicy#upload?`, member+). If the user isn't a member of the transaction's org, the upload returns `403`; do not delete the original in that case.
- **The result is a new receipt** (`rct_…`) with `upload_method = api` and `uploader` set to the token's user. The original's uploader and any extracted text do not carry over.

---

## Interpreting a `403`

The two authorization layers fail the **same way**. A scope failure (the token lacks the required scope, or a `restricted` token hit an action with no scope declaration) and a Pundit policy failure (this user may not touch this record) both raise `Pundit::NotAuthorizedError`, which renders an identical body:

```json
{ "error": "not_authorized" }
```

with status `403`. **You cannot tell the two apart from the response.** Disambiguate by construction instead:

- **Rule out scope failure up front.** Request the [recommended scopes](#recommended-scopes-for-a-receipt-agent) before you start. If a call you know your scopes cover (e.g. `GET /transactions/missing_receipt`, which needs only `ledgers:read`) returns `403`, the token is missing a scope or `restricted` is misconfigured. Fix the token; do not retry per record.
- **Otherwise treat a `403` as a per-record skip.** Once the token is known good, a `403` on a specific `POST /receipts` almost always means the user isn't a member of that transaction's organization (`ReceiptablePolicy#upload?`). Skip that transaction and continue; transactions in the user's own organizations still succeed.

Error bodies a receipt agent will encounter (full taxonomy in [`standards.md`](./standards.md#error-responses)):

| Status | Body `error` | Meaning |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| `401` | `invalid_auth` | Token missing, expired, or invalid. Re-authenticate. |
| `403` | `not_authorized` | Missing scope **or** user not permitted for this record (indistinguishable). |
| `404` | `resource_not_found` | No record for that `txn_…` / `rct_…` id. |
| `400` | `invalid_record` / `invalid_operation` | Bad params (e.g. unsupported file type, missing `file`). |

---

## Receipt-Specific Best Practices

(General guidance such as token refresh, rate limits, and error shapes lives in [`standards.md`](./standards.md).)

- **Always pass `transaction_id`.** A receipt uploaded without one lands in the user's [Receipt Bin](#the-receipt-bin), and there is no single endpoint to attach a receipt in the Receipt Bin to a transaction afterward (only the [re-upload workaround](#linking-a-receipt-in-the-receipt-bin-to-a-transaction)). If you cannot confidently match a file to a transaction, skip it and flag it for a human rather than uploading it to the Receipt Bin.
- **Treat extraction and pairing as async.** Extracted fields aren't available in the create response.
- **Uploads aren't deduped.** The same file uploaded twice creates two receipts. Use `receipts:read` (`GET /receipts?transaction_id=…`) to check whether a transaction already has a receipt, and track handled `txn_…` IDs across runs.
- **Use `missing_receipt` to discover work.** `GET /api/v4/transactions/missing_receipt` lists the user's transactions still missing a receipt across all their organizations in one call. Scoped to one organization, `GET /api/v4/organizations/:id/transactions?filters[missing_receipts]=true` does the same. Both require `ledgers:read`.
- **Marking no/lost is a last resort, and human-gated.** Never call `mark_no_receipt` autonomously. It suppresses the missing-receipt signal before anyone has searched for the receipt, so it must require explicit, per-transaction authorization from a human who has confirmed the receipt cannot be found. The agent's `receipts:write` scope permits this call, so the boundary is behavioral, not enforced.
